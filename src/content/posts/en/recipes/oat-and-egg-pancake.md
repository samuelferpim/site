## Eggs and oats every day. Every. Single. Day.

If you're here, you've probably stared at your frying pan in the morning and felt the existential weight of yet another plate of scrambled eggs. The oatmeal porridge? They don't even look at you anymore.

Relax. The solution uses **the same ingredients** — just changes the game entirely.

## The Secret: Hydrated Oats

Put **50g of fine oat flakes** in a container, cover with water until they're submerged, and seal with **plastic wrap**. Throw it in the fridge and forget about it.

The recommended time is **overnight** — prep it at night, use it in the morning. But if you forgot or decided last minute, **4 hours** is enough to get the oats soft and ready to go.

Golden tip: you can prep **portions for up to 3 days** at once. Just separate the hydrated oats into well-sealed containers in the fridge. Wake up, mix with eggs, done — zero morning effort.

Skip this hydrating step and it'll be grainy. Don't skip it.

## The Base (3 minutes, seriously)

1. Hydrated oats + **3 eggs** → mix well
2. **1 small teaspoon of baking powder** → stir in
3. Done. That's your base.

Non-stick pan, medium-low heat. Pour a little at a time — **go for several small pancakes instead of one big one**. They're easier to flip, cook more evenly, and the result is way better. Golden on the bottom, flip. No mystery.

## Now the Fun Part

The base is neutral, so you decide where to take it. Here are **some suggestions** — but feel free to get creative:

### Savory Suggestions
Salt, oregano, black pepper. Then add whatever's around: cheese, turkey, tuna, whatever the fridge has to offer.

### Sweet Suggestions
Honey, mashed banana, sweetener (fitness mode, no judgment). Want to boost the protein? Add **whey protein in neutral flavors** — chocolate, vanilla, or banana work great. One warning though: invest in a good brand. Whey with bad sweetener ruins the whole thing.

Then just enjoy and be happy.
